In this project, firstly, our task was to use the unsupervised learning method (hierarchical agglomerative clustering using single linkage) for clustering customers into different groups of the wholesale customers data set. The data set has been obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wholesale+customers.

Secondly, for each group we were required (i) to use the following supervised learning methods: 
decision tree, random forest, support vector machines,and logistic regression for classifying customers as potential (if total consumption > 33,000) or 
average (if total consumption <= 33,000), and (ii) to identify the best technique by evaluating the classification model performances using k-fold
cross-validation (k=5). 

Finally, we were asked to find the confusion matrix and ROC curve for the best method, and to calculate and interpret
Predictive value positive and negative, Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity of the test.
